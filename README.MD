# Hospital Management System (Java JDBC)

## Overview
This project is a Hospital Management System implemented in Java using JDBC for database connectivity. It runs in the command line terminal and applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to manage various hospital operations effectively.

## Features
- **Database Connectivity with JDBC**:
  - Utilizes JDBC to connect and interact with the underlying database for storing and retrieving hospital data.
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Implements OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism for modular and scalable code.
- **Command Line Interface**:
  - Runs entirely in the command line terminal, providing a straightforward interface for hospital staff to manage operations.
- **Patient and Staff Management**:
  - Manages patient records, staff details, appointments, and other administrative tasks seamlessly.
- **Data Integrity and Security**:
  - Ensures data integrity and security through proper database management practices and access controls.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity with relational databases.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc.**: Choose your preferred relational database management system.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: For designing modular and reusable code.
- **Command Line Interface**: For user interaction.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:

Setup Database:

Install and configure your preferred relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Create a database named hospital (or any preferred name).
Update the database connection details in the DatabaseManager.java file.
Compile and run the application:

Compile the Java files using your IDE or manually via command line:

javac *.java
Run the application:

java Main
Usage
Follow the on-screen prompts in the command line interface to navigate through patient management, staff management, appointments, etc.
